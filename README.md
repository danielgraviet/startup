It is built with a focus on simplicity and usability. Users log in to discover new facts or see funny gifs from The Cat API.
Users are able to chat in real time using WebSocket technology and can even react to other messages with a "paw-up" or "paw-down" feature.
The main design includes warm cat inspired colors, a cursor that is a paw, and buttons that "purr" when hovered over. 
This brings back the joy to messaging and makes chatting with friends immersive and fun.

CatNip Messaging has a Slack-inspired design with a sidebar on the left for navigation, displaying chat rooms, user lists, and settings, with a cat-themed logo. The main area displays messages against and has a cat themed background with custom graphics. It also includes a display to show random cat facts. At the bottom, a long text box lets users type messages, attach files or photos, and use emojis, all with cat-themed icons. In addition there are warm, natural tones and animations create a fun look!
