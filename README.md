CatNip Messaging has a Slack-inspired design with a sidebar on the left for navigation, displaying chat rooms, user lists, and settings, with a cat-themed logo. The main area displays messages against and has a cat themed background with custom graphics. It also includes a display to show random cat facts. At the bottom, a long text box lets users type messages, attach files or photos, and use emojis, all with cat-themed icons. In addition there are warm, natural tones and animations create a fun look!
